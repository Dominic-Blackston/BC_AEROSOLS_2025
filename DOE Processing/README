This is the main directory to convert raw and individual DOE campaign files into final restricted and comprehensive datasets.
This directory provides individual code that performs individual tasks (binning, time averaging, unit changing, etc.). 

The sequence of steps that the May Research Group took to combine the DOE campaigns are as follows:
1) DOE_combiner_raw
2) DOE_rename_columns
3) DOE_time_averaging
4) DOE_unit_change
5) DOE_binning
6) DOE_sc_abs_correction
7) DOE_restricted_comprehensive_filter
8) DOE_combine_restricted_comprehensive


DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) DOE_combiner_raw.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: Combines individual instrument files into one single campaign_csv file.
OUTPUT: campaign_raw.csv

Variables to change: 
-CAMPAIGN_NAME: name of campaign you want to combine
-campaign_path: path to individual instrument campaign files.
-file_info_path: Path to your file_info_list folder. (More details below.)
-output_folder: output path where you want to output combined instrument csvs per instrument
-RAW_CAMPAIGNS_PATH: Final path where you want the final campaign_raw.csv file to be printed

NOTES:
-file_info_path files are csv files that have information on each instruments filetype, column names, etc. Examples can be seen under "file_info_list" in this github.
-campaign_path should have individual instrument folders for the campaign. It looks something like this:
BBOP
-> instrument1
    ->instrument1_date1.csv
    ->instrument1_date2.csv
    ->....
->instrument2
    ->instrument2_date1.txt
    ->instrument2_date2.txt
    ->....
->....

2) DOE_rename_columns.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: renames raw column names into comprehensive column names.
OUTPUT: campaign_renamed.csv

Variables to change: 
-ORGANIZATION: set organization name
-CAMPAIGN_NAME_LIST: list of campaign names to rename
-COLUMN_NAME_LIST_PATH: path to column_name_list files. (More details below.)
-RAW_PATH: Original path of campaign.csvs you want to rename
-RENAMED_OUTPUT_PATH: output path to renamed.csv produced

NOTES:
-column_name_list provides mappings from original column names to new column names. See the "column_name_list" folder for examples. One file for each campaign is expected.

3) DOE_time_averaging.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: Time averages campaign.csv files by a column name.
OUTPUT: campaign_avg.csv

Variables to change: 
-raw_path: path to original campaign files that you want to time average
-avg_path: Output folder where final avg.csv files will be printed to
-time_average_list_path: Path to time_average_list.csv info file.

NOTES:
-modify time_average_list.csv to set what columns to time average by for each campaign
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4) DOE_unit_change.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: Changes units of columns for each campaign.
OUTPUT: campaign.csv, under unit_corrected_data path.

Variables to change: 
-RAW_PATH: path to original campaign files that you want to unit correct.
-OUTPUT_PATH: path to output unit changed campaign csvs
-UNIT_INFO_PATH: path to unit_info_list files for each campaign

NOTES:
-modify unit_info_list files for each campaign. Examples seen under "unit_info_list"
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) DOE_binning.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: bins campaign files into AEROSOL and COMPREHENSIVE bins we desire.
OUTPUT: campaign_binned.csv

Variables to change: 
-NEW_AEROSOL_BINS: midpoint diameter bins for aerosol distribution
-NEW_CLOUD_BINS: midpoint diameter bins for cloud distribution
-OUTPUT_PATH: output path to produce campaign_binned.csv
-INPUT_PATH: path to original campaign files that you want to bin
-BIN_INFO_PATH: path to bin_info files for each campaign

NOTES:
-modify bin_info files for each campaign. Examples under "bin_info_list"

6) DOE_sc_abs_correction.ipynb
DESCRIPTION: Translates Scattering and Absorption wavelengths to desired wavelengths
OUTPUT: campaign_wavelengthcorrected.csv

Variables to change: 
-RAW_PATH: path to original campaign files that you want to sc,abs correct
-OUTPUT_PATH: output path to sc,abs corrected data
-WAVELENGTH_INFO_PATH: path to wavelength_info files for each campaign
-SC_NEW_WAVELENGTHS: new scattering wavelengths you want to convert to
-ABS_NEW_WAVELENGTHS: new absorption wavelengths you want to convert to

NOTES:
-Modify wavelength_info files for each campaign. Examples under "wavelength_info_list"
