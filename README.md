Codes for processing data from NASA, NOAA, DOE flight campaigns to be imported into a database

Note that modified_module_a_916, getting_diameters and module_a_w_diams are outdated; they were used to get the information for the module_a_information csv file.

Much of the code is based on code written by Hanyang Li; Dr. Li's repository can be visited at https://zenodo.org/record/3967833
